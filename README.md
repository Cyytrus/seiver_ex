# Seiver

Seiver is a proof of concept that I'm working on, It's a CSV file generator with a HUGE AMOUNT OF LINES in the fastest way.

## How to run
```elixir
Seiver.Seed.ExplosiveCsv.kabuum(3_000_000)
:ok
```
- ***warning:*** the csv file will be like 200+ MB in size
  - **PLEASE BE CAREFUL**
    - ***IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS IN A TOASTER, CONSIDER RUN SOMETHING LIKE 10 ENTRIES***
